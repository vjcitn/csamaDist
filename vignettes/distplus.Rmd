# Road map

# Application: inferring steps in tumor metastasis in a breast cancer patient

We'll examine data distributed with a [2021 Genome Biology paper](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-021-00989-6) from the Gabor Marth lab.

## A view of copy number aberrations for 1Mb tiling

28 tumors were sampled and sequenced in a rapid autopsy procedure.  Copy number
variation was assessed using [FACETS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027494/).

The tissues from which tumors were taken are Br (Breast), Bo (Bone), Bn (Brain),
Ln (Lung), Lv (Liver), Pa (Pancreas), Ly (Lymph nodes), Kd (Kidney)

The (vertical) ordering of tissues is chosen to exemplify certain similarities.

For example the block of blue on chr10 is seen for only three samples.
This is an indication of a deletion.

## A cluster analysis proposed in support of the evolutionary map

This code is lightly modified from a script distributed at 
https://github.com/xiaomengh/tumor-evo-rapid-autopsy.git.

```{r doclus}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
 library(csamaDist)
 library(bioDist)
 library(bluster)
 library(cluster)
})
data(cnv_log_R)
data = cnv_log_R
samples = c('Ln7','Ln9','Ln1','BrM','BrP',
           'Ln11','Ly2','Ln3',
           'Bo3','Ln10','Bo1','Ln8','Lv3','Ln5','Bo2','Bn2','Bn1','Bn3','Bn4','Ln2',
           'Ly1','Ln6',
           'Kd1','Ln4','Lv4','Lv2','Lv1','Pa1')
rownames(data) = samples
d = dist(data, method="euclidean")
fit = hclust(d, method="average")
# the following line changes the order of the samples to produce the Fig.S3B but doesn't change the phylogenetic relationship
fit$order = c(1,4,2,5,3,13,10,20,16,11,12,15,9,17,19,14,18,21,22,7,6,8,25,27,26,28,23,24)
plot(fit)
```

## Drilling down on the clustering

### Comparing Euclidean and Correlation distances

```{r dodists}
cd = cor.dist(cnv_log_R)
ed = dist(cnv_log_R)
plot(as.numeric(ed), as.numeric(cd), xlab="All pairwise Euclidean distances", ylab="All pairwise correlation distances")
```

### A pair with discrepant correlation and euclidean distance values (over entire genome)

We'll have a look at the first 100Mb on chr1.
```{r lk1mb}
plot(cnv_log_R["Ly1",1:100],pch=19, main="chr1, first 100Mb", ylab="FACETS CNV log R", xlab="chr1")
points(cnv_log_R["Ln1",1:100], col="red",pch=19)
legend(60, -.5, pch=19, col=c("black", "red"), legend=c("Ly1", "Ln1"))
cor(cnv_log_R["Ly1", 1:100], cnv_log_R["Ln1", 1:100])
edist = function(x,y) sqrt(sum((x-y)^2))
edist(cnv_log_R["Ly1", 1:100], cnv_log_R["Ln1", 1:100])
plot(cnv_log_R["Ly1", 1:100], cnv_log_R["Ln1", 1:100], xlab="Ly1", ylab="Ln1")
abline(0,1)
```

### Redo clustering with alternative distance and agglomeration method
```{r redo}
fit2 = hclust(cd, method="ward.D2")
plot(fit2)
abline(h=.3, lty=2)
```

### Silhouette measure
 
From ?silhouette with the cluster library:

```
For each observation i, the _silhouette width_ s(i) is defined as follows:

     Put a(i) = average dissimilarity between i and all other points of
     the cluster to which i belongs (if i is the _only_ observation in
     its cluster, s(i) := 0 without further calculations).  For all
     _other_ clusters C, put d(i,C) = average dissimilarity of i to all
     observations of C.  The smallest of these d(i,C) is b(i) := \min_C
     d(i,C), and can be seen as the dissimilarity between i and its
     "neighbor" cluster, i.e., the nearest one to which it does _not_
     belong.  Finally,

                   s(i) := ( b(i) - a(i) ) / max( a(i), b(i) ).         
     
     'silhouette.default()' is now based on C code donated by Romain
     Francois (the R version being still available as
     'cluster:::silhouette.default.R').

     Observations with a large s(i) (almost 1) are very well clustered,
     a small s(i) (around 0) means that the observation lies between
     two clusters, and observations with a negative s(i) are probably
     placed in the wrong cluster.
```

```{r init}
ct1 = cutree(fit2, h=.3)
c2 = cnv_log_R
rownames(c2) = paste(rownames(c2), as.numeric(ct1))
sil = silhouette(ct1, cd)
plot(sil)
```
